    "During the time of COVID-19, many studies have been conducted to assess the widespread use of face masks in reducing the spread of the disease. This is particularly true for when masks are used universally within communities with denser populations. The CDC has advocated for masks, or any cloth face coverings for that matter, as a barrier to prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air when a person coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. CNN reports that if 95% of Americans wore face masks in public, it could prevent more than 450,000 deaths by November 1, 2020. Despite the effectiveness of preventing spread of COVID-19 when wearing a mask, many have not followed suit in the accordance with CDC guidelines. As states enter different phases of reopening, many have executed mandatory face mask use policy for employees in public-facing businesses. The concept that this specific study will measure is \n",
    "###### The effects of the policy of mandating face mask in public facing businesses  on the total number of COVID cases recorded for each state. \n",
    "We assume the dates on which the mandate was placed is critical to our study for  measuring  how the timeliness of the mandate date ultimately save thousands of lives. We also want to understand how other factors such the population at risk of serious illness, stay at home duration, business closed duration has played a role in the total number of cases and how they interact with face mask mandate policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our study, we conducted various tasks prior to our linear regression models: \n",
    "1. First, we studied the data and tried to understand the distribution of total number of cases by each state, which we used as dependent variable for our study. Our aim in understanding the distribution is to identify outliers as well as get a general idea about the dependent variable spread. \n",
    "2. Then we cleaned our data and identified issues such as duplicates or missing value that can affect our study. \n",
    "3. We also performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) in order to form our base model and identified key variables to be used for our linear regression models. \n",
    "4. We identified required data transformation for effective study and required key variables created from 'Mandate face mask in public facing business' date\n",
    "5. Furthermore, we also took into consideration the number of days businesses were closed, as the mandate only restricts employess in public-facing businesses; number of days stay at home policy was in place; population at risk and number of days the face mask mandate is in place.\n",
    "6. We studied the correlation between the independent variables and with the dependent variable to assess our assumption.\n",
    "7. We created base model and conducted 2 improvements on it. We checked the quality of model along with multicollinearity check.\n",
    "8. Lastly, we assessed CLM assumptions and verified if any voilation are there. We also summarized statitical and practical significance of our study.\n",
    "9. We did the study on ommitted variables before concluding."

    "From the ggplot and boxplot, we can see that New York,California, Florida, New Jersey and Texas have very large number of cases and also falling outside the maximum of boxplot. It makes practical sense as these states have large population concentrated in metropolitan cities like NYC, LA, etc and do not necessarily follow the characteristics of lifestyle and demographics of other states. New York cases are significantly high because of high cases in NYC alone. The city was the epicenter of the COVID cases as this is a global city with large number of people coming in from different parts of the world and the spread had started there much earlier before emergency was applied. From boxplot we can see that while most states have cases below 100,000, thee states are having much higher cases. Because of the characteristics of the lifestyle and population of these states being very different from other states, it is reasonable to assume them as outlier for this study."

    "#### Assumption MLR.2 (random sampling): \n",
    "1. The sampling method ensured all samples are randomly drawn from the population, and data points are iid—independently and identically distributed.\n",
    "2. No clustering happened in the sampling method, because we get total number of cases/death in each providence, instead of only examining a limited number of people\n",
    "3. No autocorrelation happened. We have cross-sectional data points, represented in each province, instead of time series data. So there is no significant correlation among samples in each province"

    "#### Assumption MLR.3 (no perfect collinearity): \n",
    "1. We choose MandateFaceMask_fac, and pop18_norm as our independent variables, and there is no exact relationships nor perfect collinearity among the independent variables\n"

    "#### Assumption MLR.4 (zero-conditional mean): \n",
    "1. we examine this assumption by looking at Residual vs Fitted value plot.\n",
    "2. Ideally we could get a flat red line representing zero conditional mean. \n",
    "3. Here we got some curvature on the far right in the red curve, but the magnitude of curvature is very small (<-0.2). This could be caused by the so few data points on the right side of the plot\n",
    "4. This non-normality is also reflected in the significance on the Shapiro test \n",
    "5. We don't have zero conditional mean. But because we have a large sample size of 46 (>30), we can rely on asymptotics and assess exogeneity. If we set aside causality and just look for the best fit line, exogeneity tells us that our estimates are consistent."

    "In the models that was built, we expected to find correlation between the policy of mandate face mask in public facing businesses and the total number of covid-19 cases. To our surprise, these two variables are slightly positively correlated with a weight of .2 with almost no stastical significance (p < 0.05). It contradicts our hypothesis that the mandated face mask policy will result in lesser number of covid cases. Furthermore, we find that the delay in application of  face mask policy is negatively correlated with the over all covid caess, which demonstrates a counter intuitive implication that earlier adoption of mandating face mask is correlated with a greater number of covid cases. Therefore, relating back to the research question of whether mandating face masks in public facing business reduces the spread of covid-19, we found that to be not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the data does not support our hypothesis, we still encourage other studies to be done on related topics. In hindsight, the dataset that was available was not adequately appropriate for the effect that we are trying to measure. The presence of omitted variable such as the timeline of the spread of the virus and peak point for each state inhibits the ability to accurately assess the realistic time indepdent impact of the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the result shed light on how the mandate face mask policy was implemented. Given the correlation that was found in the model, it can be explained by how policies are created. The policy of mandating face mask usage is going to be implemented, and, earlier in time, if there is an imminent threat of the virus. The correlation that we found was an indication that the policy makers are unwilling to take certain measure for prevention until it is too late. This would be a great hypothesis for another study."
